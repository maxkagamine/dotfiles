Behold, [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/html_node/index.html#Top): the mod manager for your Linux home directory! Anyone who's used Vortex or MO2 to mod games like [Skyrim](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYooEAFUfhDfO3m_WQWkHdIB3Zh2kIXKp) will find how this works surprisingly familiar: mod (dot) files are organized into separate folders, and the mod manager (stow) combines them into the game (home) directory using symlinks.

Continuing with the mod manager theme, different machines can have a different "profile" or mod list. Having written [excessively-complicated setup scripts](https://github.com/maxkagamine/dotfiles/blob/old/setup.ps1) in the past, I decided to keep things simple this time around &mdash; no [complex framework](https://alexpearce.me/2021/07/managing-dotfiles-with-nix/), no [YAML files](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) &mdash; each profile is just [a plain bash script](profiles/tamriel), sortof like a Dockerfile.

Applies the convention of loading configuration files from a directory to bashrc: after setting some common aliases and such, sources every file in **~/.config/bashrc.d/**. This way the other mods can put their stuff in e.g. bashrc.d/git.sh rather than one big file as is traditional. (The system-wide /etc/profile already does this with /etc/profile.d/*.)

[Git aliases](mods/git/.config/bashrc.d/git.bashrc) + the "gg" function I use so much [I wrote a blog post about it](https://kagamine.dev/en/gg-faster-git-commits/), and of course what would be a _Max Kagamine_ system without a myriad of [Skyrim references](https://kagamine.dev/en/fus-ro-dah/) (brace yourself).

Oh and _[empty string is git status](mods/git/.config/bashrc.d/zz_empty_string_is_git_status.sh):_

True story. This is a trick I learned a long time ago: using `PROMPT_COMMAND` to compare the last history entry to that which was seen the previous time the prompt was shown, as hitting enter at an empty prompt will run the command again, but the last history number will be the same. Side effect is hitting <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> (but not <kbd>Ctrl+U</kbd> or <kbd>Alt+Shift+#</kbd>) at a prompt will trigger git status, too.

This applies to [Tamriel, my main machine](https://photos.app.goo.gl/GYYD6cBjdmbnX3tf6) running the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/), because I can't computer without a command line but Windows is life (at least until Bethesda releases _Skyrim: Chrome OS Edition_).

> ### Setting up GPG & YubiKey for WSL
>  
> 1. Install [Gpg4win](https://gpg4win.org/download.html) & [YubiKey Manager](https://www.yubico.com/support/download/yubikey-manager/)
>    - Ignore the PINs in the PIV app; the OpenPGP app on the YubiKey [is separate](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide/issues/248). I'd even disable PIV in "Interfaces" to avoid confusion if you're not using it.
> 2. Follow [Yubico's guide here](https://developers.yubico.com/PGP/SSH_authentication/Windows.html), but hold off on cloning something since we'll do that in WSL. You don't need PuTTY (the GPG agent replaces Pageant).
>    - Use Task Scheduler to run `"C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin\gpg-connect-agent.exe" /bye` at log on. Remember to uncheck everything in Conditions. I enabled "If the task fails, restart every 1 minute" in Settings.
> 3. Use [wsl2-ssh-pageant](https://github.com/BlackReloaded/wsl2-ssh-pageant) to connect the Linux-side SSH and GPG agents to GPG running Windows-side.
> 4. After restarting WSL (`wsl.exe --shutdown`), you should be able to run `gpg --card-status` in Linuxüëç Import your public key and test that it works with `ssh git@github.com`.

For [Sovngarde, my NAS.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/GYYD6cBjdmbnX3tf6) There isn't much here (literally just a `CDPATH`), but if you're running Unraid as well, see [**How to install GNU Stow on Unraid**](https://gist.github.com/maxkagamine/7e3741b883a272230eb451bdd84a8e23). Here's my user script, set to run on array start, if it happens to be useful:

<details>
<summary><code>cat /boot/config/plugins/user.scripts/scripts/install_dotfiles/script</code></summary>

```sh
#!/bin/bash
#name=Install dotfiles
#description=&lpar;Re&rpar;clone & install dotfiles.
#argumentDescription=Branch
#argumentDefault=master
#clearLog=true
set -eo pipefail

export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
export HOME=/root

DOTFILES_DIR=~/dotfiles
BRANCH=${1:-master}

# Nuke existing dotfiles
[[ -d "$DOTFILES_DIR" ]] && make -C "$DOTFILES_DIR" clean
rm -rfv ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile "$DOTFILES_DIR"

# Clone repo
git clone -b "$BRANCH" https://github.com/maxkagamine/dotfiles.git "$DOTFILES_DIR"

# Install
cd "$DOTFILES_DIR"
make
```

</details>

## ‚öô&hairsp;[utils](mods/utils/.local/bin)

Miscellaneous utilities:

- [**append_crc32**](mods/utils/.local/bin/append_crc32) ‚Äî Adds (or updates) a file's crc32 hash to its filename.
- [**mkanimedir**](mods/utils/.local/bin/mkanimedir) ‚Äî Turns a MAL link and a bunch of episodes into a nice folder.
- [**mkv-ls**](mods/utils/.local/bin/mkv-ls) & [**mkv-batch**](mods/utils/.local/bin/mkv-batch) ‚Äî Tools for batch mkv remuxing using mkvtoolnix. `mkv-ls` shows tracks in a table similar to the GUI but groups identical track listings for batch processing with `mkv-batch`.
  
  For example, if I wanted to remove the English audio and Signs & Songs tracks:

- [**weigh**](mods/utils/.local/bin/weigh) ‚Äî Shows the total size of files, directories, or stdin (optionally gzipped).

## [bat](mods/bat/.config/bashrc.d/bat.sh)

## [dircolors](mods/dircolors)

(Psst: if you want to change your ls colors, [my file](mods/dircolors/.config/dircolors) might be an easier starting-off point than `--print-database`. I spent the time formatting it so you don't have to.)

## [docker](mods/docker/.config/bashrc.d/docker.sh)

Better `docker ps` / `docker container ls` output, inspired by [docker-pretty-ps](https://github.com/politeauthority/docker-pretty-ps):

<img src="doc/better%20docker%20ps.png" width="500" />

## [fzf](mods/fzf/.config/bashrc.d/fzf.sh)

Fancy [keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#key-bindings-for-command-line) (also powers the aforementioned [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons/3df43eb5a6dc932719159aa98d33d082cd1cceb0/icons/file_type_git.svg" height="15" />**git-branch-fzf**](mods/git/.local/bin/git-branch-fzf))

## [nano](mods/nano/.config/nano/nanorc)

<img src="doc/nano.png" height="375" />

## [node](mods/node/.config/bashrc.d/node.sh)

~~Over nine thousand node_modules files~~&ensp;Just some npm aliases.

## [starship](mods/starship/.config)

## [yt-dlp](mods/yt-dlp/.config) (youtube-dl successor)

Because nothing on the Internet is guaranteed to be there tomorrow.
