+ I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow in the knee...
+ Let me guess... someone stole your sweetroll.
+ Citizen.
+ Disrespect the law, and you disrespect me.
+ What do you need?
+ Trouble?
+ What is it?
+ No lollygaggin'.
+ My cousin's out fighting dragons, and what do I get? Guard duty.
+ Gotta keep my eyes open. Damn dragons could swoop down at any time.
+ Fear not. Come dragon or giant, we'll be ready.
+ They say Helgen got hit by a dragon. One of those horrors comes here, we'll be ready.
+ Brigands I can handle, but this talk of dragons? World's gone mad, I say.
+ Everything's in order.
+ Staying safe I hope.
+ Everything all right?
+ Helgen... destroyed by a dragon. Hard to believe, isn't it?
+ Could sure use a warm bed right about now...
+ I'd be a lot warmer and a lot happier with a bellyful of mead...
+ I mostly deal with petty thievery and drunken brawls. Been too long since we've had a good bandit raid.
+ What is it? Dragons?
+ Watch the skies, traveler.
+ They say Ulfric Stormcloak murdered the High King... with his voice! Shouted him apart!
+ No matter what else happens, the guards will always be grateful for everything you've done.
+ Yes, Dovahkiin? How can I help you?
+ Whatever you need, Dragonborn. Just say the word.
+ I fear the night. Because the werewolves and vampires don't.
+ Bit late to be wandering around, isn't it?
+ Only burglars and vampires creep around after dark. So which are you?
+ You hear that? I swear, there's something out there. In the dark.
+ I hope you're finding the city in proper order, thane.
+ I trust the day's found you well, thane.
+ How do you do, thane?
+ Just a few more hours and I can crawl under some furs...
+ Guard might get nervous, a man approaches with his weapon drawn...
+ Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch the magic!
+ By all I hold sacred... that's a Shout! Like the Greybeards on their mountain!
+ The Thu'um! He summons the Thu'um!
+ Wait... I know you.
+ Hey, you mix potions, right? Can you brew me an ale?
+ Favor the bow, eh? I'm a sword man, myself.
+ Hail, summoner. Conjure me up a warm bed, would you?
+ Destruction magic's fine, just don't go burning down any buildings.
+ Don't suppose you'd enchant my sword? Dull old blade can barely cut butter.
+ Best offense is a good defense, am I right?
+ Lightly armored means light on your feet. Smart.
+ You're like me, eh? Don't fancy those clunky two-handed weapons.
+ Hands to yourself, sneak thief.
+ Heard about you and your honeyed words...
+ You look tired, friend. The Bannered Mare has beds for rent.
+ The Bannered Mare's got warm beds and cold mead. You look like you could use both.
+ Need supplies? See Belethor at his store. Sleazy little man, but he has good stock.
+ Be glad you're here in the city, and not out in Riverwood. Those poor sods don't even have a wall.
+ Cause trouble in Whiterun, and I'll haul you into the Dragonsreach dungeon myself.
+ Helgen... destroyed by a dragon. Hard to believe, isn't it?
+ You have the Jarl's confidence, friend. And so you have mine.
+ By the gods, it's true, isn't it? A dragon has attacked Whiterun. How could mere men bring down such a beast?
+ I have to wonder... what does the Dragonborn do once he's summoned by the Greybeards? Can the Thu'um be taught, like any skill?
+ If those Whiterun guards can take down a dragon, so can we.
+ If we killed a dragon once, we can do it again. With your help of course.
+ Got to thinking... maybe I'm the Dragonborn, and I just don't know it yet?
+ The Greybeards have summoned the Dragonborn to High Hrothgar. Such a thing has not happened for... hundreds of years.
+ What could it mean? The return of the Dragonborn? And who among us could possibly hold that honor? And such power?
+ By Ysmir, you did it. You killed a dragon.
+ There's been talk amongst the guards. That you are... Dragonborn. But such a thing... Surely that's not possible...
+ You couldn't possibly be the Dragonborn of legend. Could you?
+ All hail the Dragonborn!
+ In the ancient tongue, you are Dovahkiin - Dragonborn!
+ Psst. Hey, I know who you are. Hail Sithis!
- By order of the Jarl, stop right there!
- You have committed crimes against Skyrim and her people. What say you in your defense?
- Stop right there, criminal scum!
- I need to ask you to stop. That... committing... is making people nervous.
- Never should have come here!
- You picked a bad time to get lost, friend.
